Hi, this is my first blog on this websites and hopefully many to come as I don't really have much to do with my life.

Today, I spend few hours poking around with programming langauge called c3 and linking it with [Raylib](link to raylib), popular web library.
I wanted to create something that is interactive and be able to upload to web without much hassle.

I have already created a repo for linking c3 with raylib and stress testing it using bunny rendering which I saw in being used [before](https://old.reddit.com/r/raylib/comments/15jy1x3/raylib_bunnymark_benchmark_with_100k_bunnies/)

There were few things to watch out for when compiling into wasm.

 - You need to add your own raylib.js file that handles raylib APIs such as isKeyPressed etcs...
 - You need to update c files so that it does not include any std since it will break in wasm as it doesn't have std init (hopefully I can add a flag in compile to handle std function for c3 in the future?)

 Results are below. It is somewhat a fun project.
