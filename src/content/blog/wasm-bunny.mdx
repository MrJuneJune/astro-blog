**First Steps with C3 and Raylib on WebAssembly**

Hi! This is my first blog post on this website, and hopefully, it’s the first of many, as I have some free time at the moment.

Today, I spent a few hours experimenting with the programming language [C3](https://c3-lang.org/) and linking it with a static file from [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), a popular library for creating web applications. My goal was to build something interactive and deploy it to the web with minimal hassle.

I’ve set up a repository to link C3 with Raylib and stress-test it using a bunny-rendering benchmark, inspired by this [bunnymark benchmark](https://old.reddit.com/r/raylib/comments/15jy1x3/raylib_bunnymark_benchmark_with_100k_bunnies/).

Here are some key things to keep in mind when compiling C3 and Raylib to WebAssembly (WASM):

1. **Limited WASM Support in C3**:  
   C3 has limited support for compiling to [WASM](https://c3-lang.org/faq/#platform-support). The standard library isn't usable in WASM, so any standard functions need to be rewritten or excluded. For example, I attempted to randomly assign colors to a rabbit, but there was no compile-time error, so I had to debug why WASM wasn’t loading properly. In hindsight, I should have known, given that the `--link-libc=no` flag was used in the examples.

   Example command:
   ```
   c3c compile --reloc=none --target wasm32 -g0 --link-libc=no --no-entry main.c3 raylib.c3
   ```

2. **Custom Raylib JavaScript File**:  
   Raylib APIs need to be called through a custom `raylib.js` file. As shown in the command above, there’s no static Raylib file (`raylib.a`) linked directly to WASM. Instead, Raylib APIs are accessed through JavaScript using [WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/instantiateStreaming_static). For example, `raylib::init_window` would be called in JavaScript like this:

   ```javascript
   function InitWindow(width, height, title_ptr) {
     this.ctx.canvas.width = width;
     this.ctx.canvas.height = height;
     const buffer = this.wasm.instance.exports.memory.buffer;
     document.title = cstr_by_ptr(buffer, title_ptr);
   }

   const raylibObject = {
     raylib: { InitWindow: InitWindow },
   };

   WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("main.wasm"), raylibObject).then(
     (obj) => obj.instance.exports.exported_func(),
   );
   ```

   To actaully link it together, I was lucky to find raylib.js [this repo](https://github.com/tsoding/c3-demo/blob/main/raylib.js) (Thanks tsoding!!). I only needed to add a few functions for handling clicks. The file had `RaylibJs` class which need to be turned into object from above example and used `Proxy` class to do that. I actaully never seen that API being used outside of this.

   ```javascript
   function make_environment(env) {
     return new Proxy(env, {
       get(_target, prop, _receiver) {
         if (env[prop] !== undefined) {
           return env[prop].bind(env);
         }
         return (...args) => {
           throw new Error(`NOT IMPLEMENTED: ${prop} ${args}`);
         };
       },
     });
   }

   class RaylibJs {
      // will have all raylib functions 
      ...

      IsMouseButtonPressed(key) {
        return this.currentIsMouseButtonPressed == key;
      }

      // entrypoints to fetch wasm and start it.
      start(wasmPath, canvasId) {
        ...

        this.wasm = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(wasmPath), {
          env: make_environment(this),
        });

        // Call the main functions from wasm object
        this.wasm.instance.exports.main();
      }
    }
   ```

Overall, this was an interesting project to spend a few hours on, and maybe in the future, I’ll explore compiling the C3 standard library to WASM.

Below are the results!
